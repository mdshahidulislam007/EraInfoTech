When i tried to connect python code with MongoDB Atlas i faced these problems:

1.client = MongoClient("mongodb+srv://test:test@cluster0-0qpab.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority")
 in this line the connection string should be....
    mongodb atlas->cluster->connect->connect to python application
        -> select driver==python and proper version
            ->copy the connection string->replace <password> with your password

2.Then i faced 'dnspython' module is not found
 To solve this error run 'pip install dnspython' in cmd for download this module
 after this 'import dns' in your python code
