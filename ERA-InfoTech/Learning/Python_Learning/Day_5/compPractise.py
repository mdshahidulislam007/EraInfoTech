#1: Suppose we want to create an output dictionary which contains only the odd numbers that are present in the input list as keys and their cubes as values. Letâ€™s see how to do this using for loops and dictionary comprehension.

#solve using for loop

myDict={1,2,3,4,5}
resultDict={}

for x in myDict:
    if x%2 !=0:
        resultDict[x]=x**3
print("Using 'For loop' Output Dictionary Is: ",resultDict)

#solve using list comprehension

result={ i:i**3 for i in myDict if i%2!=0}
print("Using 'List Comprehension' Output Dictionary Is: ",result)
